## What is ContractChicken?

ContractChicken is a powerful command-line tool designed to expedite the process of mocking RESTful APIs effortlessly. It seamlessly integrates OpenAPI schemas, enhancing the speed and efficiency of API development.

## What Can ContractChicken Do?
![mock_service](resources/mock_service.png)
*Mock a RESTful API service quickly*


![mock_new_services](resources/new_service.png)
*Mock new services in existing architecture*

![link_services](resources/link_services.png)
*Link existing services without any development time.*

![prototype_architecture](resources/prototype_architecture.png)
*Prototype your entire backend by chaining multiple ContractChicken services.*

ContractChicken empowers developers to:

- **Mock RESTful APIs**: Quickly create mock APIs from OpenAPI schemas.
- **Customize HTTP Status Codes**: Return different HTTP status codes for any endpoint in your contract using the `status=` query parameter.
- **Introduce Delays**: Simulate slow network conditions by adding artificial delays to responses with the `delay=` query parameter.

## Installing ContractChicken

You can easily install ContractChicken by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g contractchicken
```
Get up and running by downloading one of our <a href="/example_contracts/">Example Contracts</a> and then running:

```bash
npx contractchicken [DOWNLOADED_CONTRACT_LOCATION]
```

## Using ContractChicken

Get started with ContractChicken by running the following command, replacing [OPENAPI_CONTRACT_LOCATION] with the location of your OpenAPI contract:
```bash
contractchicken [OPENAPI_CONTRACT_LOCATION]
```
### Returning Different HTTP Status Codes

You can customize the HTTP status code returned from any endpoint in your contract. Simply include the `status=` query parameter in your request with the desired status code.

### Returning with Delays

ContractChicken allows you to introduce delays to your responses, simulating slow network conditions. To add a delay, include the `delay=` query parameter in your request, specifying the delay time in milliseconds. This feature is particularly useful for testing under adverse network conditions.
